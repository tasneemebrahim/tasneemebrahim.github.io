      The Science Fellows are a subset of <a class="text-link" href="https://writing.barnard.edu/writing-fellows">Barnard College's Writing Fellows program.</a>
      <br>
      We are Writing Fellows pursuing majors in a large variety of subjects, but have taken rigorous science courses and pursued our own research interests.
      In doing so, we have realized the importance of scientific writing to success at Barnard and beyond.
      <br>
      We work closely with science professors across departments to support every student in developing tools to
      describe and interpret data, use scientific language clearly and concisely, and blend the skills learned in humanities classes with scientific ones.
